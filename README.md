# Meshing Techniques for CFD

Microsoft Visual Studio C++ .NET (2013) and Legacy OpenGL project to demonstrate three diferent meshing techniques for Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The following three meshing algorithms are used in this project:
1. Multi Surface Methods (MSM)
2. Transfinite Interpolation (TFI)
3. Elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDE)

## Getting Started

Just download and open the Visual Studio Solution file with extension "sln" from within the Visual Studio.

### Prerequisites

The project depends on the following system libraries.

```
OpenGL32.lib
Glu32.lib
Gdi32.lib
USer32.lib
```

### Installing

Install Visual Studio 2013 or higher. Build the project from within the Visual Studio and it should start running.
In case, there are build errors for "Entry Point" implement the following steps

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
